Designing a pervasive and real-time blood glucose tracking system is crucial yet challenging. Existing devices either limited by the discontinuous usage (\eg finger pricking) or life interference (\ie continuous blood glucose monitor), preventing users measuring their blood glucose value regularly.
The traditional inference models, however, suffer from the sparse data, resulting in the issue of low accuracy.
In this paper, we implemented \sysname, a mobile framework tracking personal blood glucose level in real time.
By adopting a novel statistical model \modelname, \sysname gets rid
of the sparsity of individual blood glucose data, and then encodes the relationships between external factors and blood glucose levels comprehensively. The inference results could benefit users in learning their
blood glucose alternation without interference, and further guiding their healthy behaviors (\eg the amount of food, drug and insulin intake, the sleep duration). We implemented \sysname on iOS platform and examined its performance on 112 participants over 7 months. The results show that \modelname outperforms the traditional statistical models, and achieves desirable monitor accuracy, making \sysname satisfy in daily use.
