 Blood glucose indicates the amount of sugar present in a personal body. It usually comes from the food intake and is the primary source of energy utilized by body.
 \subsection{Physiology of Blood Glucose }
 Glucose is transported from the intestines or liver to body cells via the bloodstream, and is made available for cell digestion via the hormone insulin, released by the pancreas. While the glucose level rising, the pancreas produces insulin to promote the transfer of glucose from the blood to the cells of muscle and fat, and to increase the uptake of glucose into the liver. While the glucose level decreasing, the insulin level drops as well and the liver increases glucose production  to bring the blood glucose level back to normal.
 
 Normally, a health individual body can properly regulate the blood glucose level with a range of 4.4 mmol/L to 6.1 mmol/L \cite{bib:blood_sugar}, and slightly grows up 7.8 mmol/L after eating. For those whose blood glucose level keeping above 7.8 mmol/L for a prolonged period, they take the risks of diabetes mellitus, and should take hypoglycemic drugs or inject insulin to control the blood glucose. If the blood glucose level descends under 4.4 mmol/L, it is a sign of hypoglycemia. Accordingly, we classify the blood glucose values into four levels in Table~\ref{blood_glucose_levels}.

(7.8, $+\infty$)                               & Level 4                & High Blood Glucose                         \\ \hline

\subsection{Impact Factors of Blood Glucose}
 Blood glucose level is mainly determined by two dimensional factors:  the internal factors and the external factors. The internal factors indicates the genetics of persons. Many clinic researches or reports have demonstrated genetics are associated with diabetes \cite{bib:simpson1978genetics,bib:diabetes_co_uk,bib:rotter1984genetics,bib:concannon2009genetics,bib:salopuro2004common}.
 It is different from individuals. The external factors are mainly composed of food intakes, the exercise, the sleep quality and drugs or insulin inputs~\cite{bib:duke2010intelligent}. The physiological mechanism of external factors on blood glucose are shown as follows.
 
\paragraph{Food intake}: The carbohydrates of the food intake can be quickly absorbed by gut and turned into the blood glucose. A steep rising trend usually occurs after consuming high-carbohydrate meals. Naturally, high-carbohydrate foods (\eg white grain products, bread and cookies) contributes higher blood glucose levels than low/moderate-carbohydrate foods (\eg meat, vegetables).
Hence, the food intake is an important external factor of blood glucose.
\paragraph{Exercise}: Exercise impacts the blood glucose level by the energy consumption. The movement of muscles will trigger the body cells absorbing sugar from blood for energy of doing exercise.  Depending on the intensity
