\subsection{External factor collection}
Sensing module is mainly designed for collected the external factors of users.

\paragraph{Food intake}

\paragraph{Activity factors}
Since the carbohydrate in the body can be consumed by daily exercise, resulting to varying the blood glucose level, \sysname adopts an effective and power efficient approach \cite{bib:kwapisz2011activity} to recognize six common user's daily activities, and record the corresponding durations. The caloric expenditure can be easily consumed by the calorie burn calculator formulas in \cite{bib:zhan2012accurate}, which has been widely used by multiple mobile sport applications \cite{}
calculates the total calories consumed based o
